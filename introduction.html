	<p>Orphans and the underprivileged are two groups that often find themselves in difficult social and economic situations. They require attention, support, and assistance from society to help them overcome life's challenges.</p>

<p>An orphan refers to a child who has lost one or both parents due to death. They grow up without the love and support typically provided by parents. Orphans often face emotional, psychological, and financial challenges. They need social support, education, healthcare, and equal opportunities to grow and thrive.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the underprivileged, or dhufa', refers to individuals who are poor or marginalized in society. They may lack adequate access to education, healthcare, and economic resources. The underprivileged often struggle to meet basic needs such as food, clothing, and shelter. They may also experience discrimination and social stigma.</p>

<p>Both of these groups require broad support from the community. Assistance can come in the form of financial aid, food, clothing, and shelter. Additionally, they need access to quality education, healthcare services, and economic opportunities to help them rise above their challenging circumstances.</p>

<p>Humanitarian organizations, governments, and civil society play a crucial role in providing attention and assistance to orphans and the underprivileged. Programs such as scholarships, social welfare initiatives, skills training, and poverty alleviation programs can help improve their lives and provide them with equal opportunities in society.</p>

<p>It is important to recognize that orphans and the underprivileged are valuable individuals with unlimited potential. In the spirit of social justice and humanity, we must strive to achieve equality and fairness for them, providing the attention and assistance they need to live with dignity and have a bright future.
